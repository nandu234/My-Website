                <h2>Courage</h2>
                <p>
                    Courage is a main value of mine because you have to always be willing to try new, risky things because they will allow you to have different experiences and see different perspectives. This will make your life more interesting and will keep your life fresh, both of which will make you a happier, more satisfied person. Courage is also important because you need courage in order to be honest when you've made a mistake and to be willing to keep going when everything you are working towards looks bleak.

                <p>
                    Perseverance is important to me because I believe that the only way to become great at anything is to work hard and persevere through the tough times to keep fighting for your dreams.

                <h2>Respect</h2>
                <p>
                    Respect is one of my core values because being respected by others allows me to express my opinions and feel that I am part of a community. Also, respecting others is just as important because that allows them to feel comfortable and happy being themselves, which is a key factor in preventing future mental health issues, something that is becoming a bigger and bigger problem.

                <h2>Teamwork</h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork is very important because without it, you will go nowhere and do nothing. You cannot achieve your dreams without teamwork because you will always need someone to convince you to keep working when you get the feeling that you will never be good in your field and when you need the help of other people when designing something or trying to achieve something. This is because you are a human being and don't know everything.

                <h2>Trust</h2>
                <p>
                    Trust is extremely critical to your success in life because is you lose someone's trust, that means they will not believe you when you come to them with a problem and will never be as close with you as they were before you lost their trust. This will result in you being unhappy and will lead to a deep dissatisfaction with your life because you will have no one who truly cares about you. On top of this, whenever you need motivation to keep going or help in your endeavor, you won't be able to get it because no one trusts you and therefore will not spend the time necessary to help you, which will likely result in you giving up on what you were trying to achieve.
