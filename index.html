        <h2>My Backstory</h2>
         <h5>How I got Interested in Software Development</h5> 
        </div> 
        <img src="subwaysurfers.jpg"/> 
    </div> 
    <p>When I was young, I loved playing Subway Surfers and Jetpack Joyride and thought about how fun it would be if I got to play an extremely fun game that I made myself.</p> 
    <p>So, I started doing some research on how to design video games such as those and I learned I had to be very comfortable with coding in multiple different languages. Although I no longer want to design a game, I have realized that coding is the future, which means I must have some knowledge of it in order to have the highest chance of being successful in my field of choice. </p>

     <h2>My Vision and Goals</h2>
      <h5>What I aspire to become in the future</h5>
       <div>
         <img src =""/> 
        </div>
         <p>I aspire to become a lawyer who upholds justice and is world renowned. I also aspire to get into a great college and be very happy in my life as well. </p>
          <p>This section describes a clear, yet imaginative picture of what you aspire to achieve in the future. Your vision will become the driving force behind everything you do in your life. In order for your vision/goals to actually be meaningful and helpful, it should be short and specific.
